# Advent of Code 2022

My solutions to the puzzles from [advent of code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

My goal is to:
- Focus on using iterators and fp styles of problem solving
- Avoid mutability under most circumstances
- Avoid shortcuts like `.unwrap()`

You can run each puzzle solution individually from within their sub-directories using:
```sh
cargo run
```

Or validate the entire solution set from the top level directory with:
```sh
cargo test --release
```
